                <h1 class="">Conor McGregor : The Undisputed Champion of UFC</h1>
                <p class="justify-content-force">Conor Anthony McGregor, born on July 14, 1988, is an Irish professional mixed martial artist, boxer, businessman, and actor. He gained fame as “The Notorious” in the UFC, where he became the first fighter to hold championships in two weight classes simultaneously. Known for his striking precision and knockout power, McGregor’s victories often come via punches. His trash-talking style outside the arena earned him the moniker “The Notorious.” Despite controversies, he remains a PPV draw, headlining the highest-selling UFC events. His boxing debut against Floyd Mayweather Jr. garnered over 5.3 million buys. Forbes ranked him the world’s highest-paid athlete in 2021, with reported earnings of $180 million.</p>
